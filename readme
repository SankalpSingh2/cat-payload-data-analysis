Field Rated Payload (FRP) Calculation: 

For each truck, the Field Rated Payload (FRP) is calculated using the formula: FRP = Rated Gross Machine Weight − Body Weight 
whhich gives the payload capacity of the truck by subtracting the empty body weight from the total rated gross weight of the truck.

frp for each truck: 
Truck 785:
Rated Gross Machine Weight: 550,000 lbs
Body Weight: 57,779 lbs
FRP = 550,000 - 57,779 = 492,221 lbs

Truck 789:
Rated Gross Machine Weight: 715,000 lbs
Body Weight: 60,406 lbs
FRP = 715,000 - 60,406 = 654,594 lbs

Truck 793:
Rated Gross Machine Weight: 890,668 lbs
Body Weight: 66,471 lbs
FRP = 890,668 - 66,471 = 824,197 lbs

code expalnation:

10% rule: no more than 10% of the truck's payloads should exceed 110% of the FRP.
Mean rule: The average payload should not exceed the FRP.
20% rule: no single payload should exceed 120% of the FRP.

Steps:
The FRP for each truck (785, 789, 793) is calculated using the difference between the rated gross machine weight and body weight, as shown above.
Two thresholds are defined based on FRP:
110% Threshold: 1.10×FRP
120% Threshold: 1.20×FRP
Check for 120% Violations:

The code checks if any payloads exceed 120% of the FRP (which violates the 20% rule). It prints the violating records if any are found.
The percentage of payloads exceeding 110% of the FRP is calculated. If more than 10% of the payloads exceed this threshold, a violation of the 10% rule is reported.
The average payload is calculated and compared to the FRP. If the mean exceeds the FRP, a violation of the mean rule is flagged.
